# Eat The Burger 
​
### What it does:
​
* Eat-The-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
​
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
​
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
​
* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
